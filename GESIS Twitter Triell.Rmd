```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r, include=FALSE}

# load twitter tokens from separate file (not shared on github for privacy reasons)
```

## Chapter 1

This is some text.

These are bullet points:

-   Lorem
-   Ipsum
  - etc.
  
This is an enumeration:

1. First line
2. Second line
3. Third line

This is how you emphasise text: _emphasised_. And this his how to write in bold: **bold**.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
